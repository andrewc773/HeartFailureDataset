This data exploration analyzes a labeled dataset that gives features to predict the existence of heart disease within a patient. Supervised learning is used in the notebook. Both Decision Tree and XGBoost implementations are used to predict heart disease. The performance of the models are compared, before and after hyperparameter tuning.
